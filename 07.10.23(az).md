## Physical infrastructure

### Regions 

when deploy a resource in Azure, you often need to choose the region where you want your resource deployed. (A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.)

### Availability zones

Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. (They have independent power, cooling and networking. They set up as an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.) (!!!To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. However, not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones.!!!)

use for :

- Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
- Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
- Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.

### Region pairs

Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters

### Sovereign Regions

In addition to regular regions, Azure also has sovereign regions. Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. (like China)

## Management infrastructure

### resources and resource group

**resources:** Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. (VMs, virtual networks, etc.)

**resource group:** Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. Resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.

### subscriptions

In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. 

**billing boundary:** Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.

**access control boundary:** This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.

### management groups

All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group, the same way that resource groups inherit settings from subscriptions and resources inherit from resource groups. Management groups can be nested.

# Compute and networking services

## Azure virtual machines

### scale sets

Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes.

### availability sets

Virtual machine availability sets are another tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment. Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.

### move to the cloud with VMs

move from a physical server to the cloud.

### VM resources

size, storage disks networking and so on.

## Azure containers

## Azure functions

Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers. (Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.)

## application hosting options(Azure App Service)

App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. It supports multiple languages, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. It also supports both Windows and Linux environments.

### Web apps

App Service includes full support for hosting web apps. You can choose either Windows or Linux as the host operating system.

### API apps

Much like hosting a website, you can build REST-based web APIs by using your choice of language and framework. You get full Swagger support and the ability to package and publish your API in Azure Marketplace. The produced apps can be consumed from any HTTP- or HTTPS-based client.

### WebJobs

WebJobs are often used to run background tasks as part of your application logic.

### Mobile apps

Use the Mobile Apps feature of App Service to quickly build a back end for iOS and Android apps. With just a few actions in the Azure portal, you can:

Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database.
Authenticate customers against common social providers, such as MSA, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.
Send push notifications.
Execute custom back-end logic in C# or Node.js.
On the mobile app side, there's SDK support for native iOS and Android, Xamarin, and React native apps.

## Azure Virtual Networking

### Isolation and segmentation

Azure virtual network allows you to create multiple isolated virtual networks. The IP range only exists within the virtual network and isn't internet routable. 

### Internet communications

You can enable incoming connections from the internet by assigning a public IP address to an Azure resource, or putting the resource behind a public load balancer.

### Communicate between Azure resources

Virtual networks and Service endpoints

### Communicate with on-premises resources

Azure virtual networks enable you to link resources together in your on-premises environment and within your Azure subscription. In effect, you can create a network that spans both your local and cloud environments.

1. Point-to-site virtual private network connections are from a computer outside your organization back into your corporate network. In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect to the Azure virtual network.

2. Site-to-site virtual private networks link your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.

3. Azure ExpressRoute provides a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet. ExpressRoute is useful for environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security.

### Route network traffic

By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. You also can control routing and override those settings.

Route tables allow you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server, or Azure ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.

### Filter network traffic

Network security groups are Azure resources that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

Network virtual appliances are specialized VMs that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. A network virtual appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.

### Connect virtual networks

You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering. Peering allows two virtual networks to connect directly to each other. Network traffic between peered networks is private, and travels on the Microsoft backbone network, never entering the public internet. 

## Azure virtual private networks

### VPN gateways

Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual network and enable the following connectivity:

1. Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.

2. Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.

3. Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.

You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network. However, you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.

#### Policy-based VPN (filter based on IP)

Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel. This type of device evaluates every data packet against those sets of IP addresses to choose the tunnel where that packet is going to be sent through.

#### Route-based VPN (filter based on IP route) (first choose)

IPSec tunnels are modeled as a network interface or virtual tunnel interface. IP routing (either static routes or dynamic routing protocols) decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending each packet. They're more resilient to topology changes such as the creation of new subnets.

Use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of connectivity:

- Connections between virtual networks
- Point-to-site connections
- Multisite connections
- Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway

### High-availability scenarios

### Active/standby

By default, VPN gateways are deployed as two instances in an active/standby configuration, even if you only see one VPN gateway resource in Azure. Standby starts when active instances is corrupted.

### Active/active

With the introduction of support for the BGP routing protocol, you can also deploy VPN gateways in an active/active configuration. In this configuration, you assign a unique public IP address to each instance. 

### ExpressRoute failover

Another high-availability option is to configure a VPN gateway as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections. In high-availability scenarios, where there's risk associated with an outage of an ExpressRoute circuit, you can also provision a VPN gateway that uses the internet as an alternative method of connectivity. In this way, you can ensure there's always a connection to the virtual networks.

### Zone-redundant gateways

In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration. Deploying gateways in Azure availability zones physically and logically separates gateways within a region while protecting your on-premises network connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures. These gateways require different gateway stock keeping units (SKUs) and use Standard public IP addresses instead of Basic public IP addresses.
